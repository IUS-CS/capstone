## Overview

This Android Application will provide notifications to users of local utility outages in the region. Users will be able to report local outages on their phone via Google Maps API. Other users in the area will start to receive a notification once a certain threshold has been met for local reporting.  This will also be targeted to utility workers in order to produce a faster response time to resolve outages. More specifically, users can report utility problems on their smartphones and the application will facilitate communication between users via Android notification or email. Once a certain threshold has been met, then users in the area will receive notifications about the reportage outage. The Vendor will be able to follow up on Outage Reports that have been submitted by a Reporter. Reporter users will be able to view updates made to their Outage Report from the Vendor as well as respond. Consumer users will have the ability to view Open Outage Reports in their area that have been created by the Reporter user.
